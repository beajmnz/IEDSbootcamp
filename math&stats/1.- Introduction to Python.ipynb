There resides most of its strengths but, at the same time, we cannot have everything we need or may need from the base installation.\n","\n","There are many different Python projects that have built a set of consistent functions that we can use for our daily work. These functions are packed in external modules that we can load in our projects (we will use the words *module*, *package* and *library* to refer these packs, however there are subtle but important differences bewteen them).\n","\n","The most important libraries we will use duing this course are:\n","\n","- numpy (typically as `np`): For numerical anlysis. See [manual](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/contents.html).\n","- scipy: For scientific computing. See the [scipy lecture notes](http://scipy-lectures.org/index.html). We will extensively use the submodule `stats` of the scipy library for statistical modeling.\n","- pandas:   For data structuring and manipulation. See [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [cheatsheet](http://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).\n","- matplotlib: For 2D plots. See [tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html).\n","\n","The way we load them is through the use of different Python **keywords**, the main one is **import**. Then to load the **pandas** library we would do\n","\n","```python\n","import pandas\n","```\n","\n","however there are common abbreviations to these packages so that we do not have to write the whole name everytime, then we would do\n","\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","```\n","\n","now once we want to use any of these pandas functions, say the **Series** one, we must do it as\n","\n","```python\n","pd.Series()\n","```\n","\n","in such a way that our interpreter knows that we are calling for the Series function inside the Pandas library, i.e. the abbreviation is a reference name for the whole library.\n","\n","Some other times we do not want or need to import the whole set of functions in the library then we can restrict the importation as much as we want, for example, the **pyplot** module in **matplotlib** can be imported as\n","\n","```python\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","```\n","\n","some others we just want a very small set of functions, for example the ones corresponding to the normal distribution from the **scipy** library, then we do\n","\n","```python\n","from scipy.stats import norm\n","```\n","\n","This modules structure is a common source of confusion when we take our first steps in Python, and most of our difficulties could be sum up in one single question: \"how do I know where is the function I need or even if it exists?\" The short answer is *with practise* which implies that many times we have to take a long tour through the documentation or the web looking for some of the answers."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uixhlaeJN2PA","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##3.- Types of Data\n","\n","Just as with the functions of the base installations, which do not contain all the functions we may ever need, the base data types are rather general and powerful but do not satisfy the needs of data analysis.
