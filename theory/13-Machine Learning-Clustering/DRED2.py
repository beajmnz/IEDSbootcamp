1.
Build a dataset with 4 variables where 100% of the explained variance is reached
with only 2 components.
2.
Can you describe the variance explained in a dataset with 4 variables (X,Y,Z,T)
where cor(Z,T) = 1
3.
Which is the number of principal components that we should take to explain the
100% of the variance for a dataset with 4 variables (X,Y,Z,T) where Z=Y, T=7,
X~N(1,1) and Y~N(1,1)? And if X~N(1,1000) and Y~N(1,1000)?
